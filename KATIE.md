This file provides guidance when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Django Learning Management System (LMS) called "lms_platform" - a portfolio project demonstrating full-stack Django development skills for education technology applications. The project showcases user authentication, role-based permissions, complex database relationships, file uploads, and real-world business logic.

## Learning & Development Approach

**Preferred Communication Style:**
- **Tutorial-style learning experience** - treat this as an educational walkthrough
- **Step-by-step processes** - break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **One step at a time** - wait for confirmation before proceeding to next step
- **Decision-making collaboration** - ask about approach preferences (e.g., Option A vs Option B)
- **Hands-on learning** - focus on practical implementation over theory
- **Troubleshooting together** - debug issues systematically when they arise
- **Document after major features** - update README and KATIE.md after completing significant functionality

Recent prompt:
We're still having issues with what is and is not shown in the admin portal. I tried having Claude Desktop help, as well. Please review the KATIE.md, admin.py, change_form.html, and any other files you think necessary to solve this.

1. User tab for PortfolioDemo shows dictionary for username: "Username:
{'name': 'username', 'label': 'username', 'help_text': 'Required. 150 characters or fewer. Letters, digits and @/./+/-/_ only.', 'field': 'username', 'is_hidden': False}"

2. User tab for PortfolioDemo shows dictionaries instead of actual elements under Permissions: "Permissions
Active

Staff status:
{'name': 'is_staff', 'label': 'staff status', 'help_text': 'Designates whether the user can log into this admin site.', 'field': 'is_staff', 'is_hidden': False}
Superuser status:
{'name': 'is_superuser', 'label': 'superuser status', 'help_text': 'Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.', 'field': 'is_superuser', 'is_hidden': False}"

3. The "Change Password" feature is still not visible for the non-demo users. Superusers (i.e. SuperKatie) should be able to change any user's password. The demo user ("PortfolioDemo") should not be able to change ANY passwords.

I've even tried viewing in entirely different browsers to prevent cache issues from messing up the display.

Claude Code response after attempting fix of above issue:
Summary of Fixes

  I've identified and fixed the three main issues:

  1. Dictionary Display Issue âœ…

  Problem: Template was rendering {{ field.field|safe }} which displayed
  dictionary representations instead of form widgets.

  Fix: Changed
  /workspaces/lms-python/lms_platform/templates/admin/change_form.html:
  - {{ field.field|safe }} â†’ {{ field }}
  - {{ field.label_tag|safe }} â†’ {{ field.label_tag }}

  2. Password Change Visibility âœ…

  Problem: Password change link wasn't appearing for superusers on non-demo
  users.

  Fix: Enhanced DemoUserAdmin.change_view() in admin.py:359-381 to properly
  set the has_change_password_permission context variable based on user type
  and permissions.

  3. Demo User Restrictions âœ…

  Confirmed: Demo user (PortfolioDemo) properly blocked from password changes
   while superusers (SuperKatie) can change other users' passwords.

  The Django application passes all system checks and the fixes should
  resolve:
  - Form fields displaying as proper widgets instead of dictionaries
  - Password change links appearing for authorized users
  - Demo user maintaining view-only access as intended

  The template now correctly renders form fields using Django's standard
  admin form rendering, and the permission system properly differentiates
  between demo users and superusers.
