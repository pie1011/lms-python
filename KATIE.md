## Project Overview

This is a Django Learning Management System (LMS) called "lms_platform" - a portfolio project demonstrating full-stack Django development skills for education technology applications. The project showcases user authentication, role-based permissions, complex database relationships, file uploads, and real-world business logic.

## Learning & Development Approach

**Preferred Communication Style:**
- **Tutorial-style learning experience** - treat this as an educational walkthrough
- **Step-by-step processes** - break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **One step at a time** - wait for confirmation before proceeding to next step
- **Decision-making collaboration** - ask about approach preferences (e.g., Option A vs Option B)
- **Hands-on learning** - focus on practical implementation over theory
- **Troubleshooting together** - debug issues systematically when they arise

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- `lms_platform/` - Main Django project directory
  - `settings.py` - Django configuration with environment variable management
  - `urls.py` - Main URL routing
  - `core/models.py` - Database models (implemented)
  - `core/views.py` - Application views (basic index view implemented)
  - `core/admin.py` - Custom admin configurations
  - `templates/` - HTML templates (admin templates implemented)
  - `static/` - Static files (CSS organized and implemented)
- `manage.py` - Django management script
- `db.sqlite3` - SQLite database file (development)

### Key Configuration
- Uses `python-decouple` for environment variable management
- Configured for both development (SQLite) and production (PostgreSQL) databases
- Static files served with whitenoise for production deployment
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables via `python-decouple`:
- `SECRET_KEY` - Django secret key
- `DEBUG` - Debug mode toggle
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Comma-separated list of allowed hosts

## Deployment Notes

- **Target Platform:** Render (free tier)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL in production, SQLite in development
- **Static Files:** Managed by whitenoise with proper collection
- **Process:** Auto-deploy from GitHub main branch
- **Static File Collection:** Must run `collectstatic` before deployment

## Development Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver

# Collect static files (required before deployment)
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Create and apply migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser for admin access
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Set up production data (sample users, courses, etc.)
python manage.py setup_production
```

### Django Management
```bash
# Start a Django shell
python manage.py shell

# Run Django's built-in tests
python manage.py test
```

## Troubleshooting Notes

### Template Issues Resolved
- **Template inheritance:** Learned proper Django block structure for admin templates
- **Static files:** Resolved CSS loading issues by moving from inline styles to external files
- **Data display:** Fixed Django admin list views by using proper `{% result_list cl %}` template tags
- **Debug technique:** Used temporary debug output in templates to identify missing context variables

### Common Development Workflow
1. Make changes to templates or CSS
2. Run `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` if CSS changes made
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
4. Test functionality before proceeding to next step

## Next Development Goals
- [ ] Style admin add/edit forms
- [ ] Add real data counts to dashboard
- [ ] Create instructor and student frontend portals
- [ ] Implement file upload functionality
- [ ] Add grade calculation features
