This file provides guidance when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Django Learning Management System (LMS) called "lms_platform" - a portfolio project demonstrating full-stack Django development skills for education technology applications. The project showcases user authentication, role-based permissions, complex database relationships, file uploads, and real-world business logic.

## Learning & Development Approach

**Preferred Communication Style:**
- **Tutorial-style learning experience** - treat this as an educational walkthrough
- **Step-by-step processes** - break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **One step at a time** - wait for confirmation before proceeding to next step
- **Decision-making collaboration** - ask about approach preferences (e.g., Option A vs Option B)
- **Hands-on learning** - focus on practical implementation over theory
- **Troubleshooting together** - debug issues systematically when they arise

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- `lms_platform/` - Main Django project directory
  - `settings.py` - Django configuration with environment variable management
  - `urls.py` - Main URL routing with custom admin integration
  - `core/models.py` - Database models (implemented)
  - `core/admin.py` - Custom admin site with real-time data
  - `core/views.py` - Application views (basic index view implemented)
  - `templates/` - HTML templates (admin templates completed)
  - `static/` - Static files (CSS organized and implemented)
- `manage.py` - Django management script
- `db.sqlite3` - SQLite database file (development)

### Key Configuration
- Uses `python-decouple` for environment variable management
- Configured for both development (SQLite) and production (PostgreSQL) databases
- Static files served with whitenoise for production deployment
- Custom admin site integration for real-time dashboard data

## Troubleshooting Notes

### Recent Issues Resolved
- **Custom Admin Site:** Fixed URL routing to use custom admin with real-time data
- **User Model Registration:** Added Django's User model to custom admin site
- **Template Block Structure:** Learned proper Django admin template inheritance
- **Static Files:** Resolved CSS loading by moving from inline styles to external files
- **Data Display:** Fixed list views using proper `{% result_list cl %}` template tags
- **Form Styling:** Consistent button sizing and spacing across all admin forms
- **Date/Time Inputs:** Implemented HTML5 datetime-local widgets for proper date pickers
- **Logout Functionality:** Fixed authentication by using POST requests instead of GET

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to models, templates, or CSS
2. Run `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` if CSS changes made
3. Test functionality thoroughly before proceeding
4. Commit meaningful changes with descriptive messages
5. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache when testing

- [ ] **Student Authentication:** Login/logout system for students
- [ ] **Course View:** Student interface to view enrolled courses and modules
- [ ] **Assignment Submission:** Frontend form for students to submit work
- [ ] **Grade Viewing:** Interface for students to check their grades and feedback
